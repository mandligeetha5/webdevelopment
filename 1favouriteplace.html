         Ooty is one of the most frequented holiday destinations for tourists from Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka. Given the fact that the southern part of India gets too hot during the summer season, a trip to Ooty offers the much-needed respite from the heat. This picturesque and serene hill station is also a popular honeymoon destination among couples. Ooty offers stunning views of the Nilgiri Hills and lush green landscapes dotted with alpine woods, clear lakes, emerald green tea estates, and colourful blossoms. The hill station also houses the popular Nilgiri Mountain Railway which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2005.
